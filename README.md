# Postbellum plot
After 5 years of a global pandemic, the deadly virus develops a new strain which kills almost all the humans in the next month, leaving around 300,000 people alive on the whole planet. After a while, the corpses of the dead started to reanimate, haunting the lucky ones who survived the strain. You wake up 12 days after the global extinction. 12 hours before the first reanimation case. 220 hours before the first mutation. Decide how many hours it is before your death.
